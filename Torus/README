An  torus is a surface having a single "hole" usually.
In general, tori can also have multiple holes, with the term n-torus used for a torus with n holes. 
The special case of a 2-torus is sometimes called the double torus, 
the 3-torus is called the triple torus, and the usual single-holed torus is then simple called "the" or "a" torus.
