A cone is another three-dimensional shape (3D shape) that has a flat base (which is of circular shape) and a pointed tip at the top. 
The pointed end at the top of the cone is called ‘Apex’. 
A cone also has a curved surface. Similar to a cylinder, a cone can also be classified as a right circular cone and an oblique cone.
