A trapezoidal prism is a 3D figure which has trapezoid cross-sections in one direction and rectangular cross-sections i
n the other direction which means the prism has two congruent trapezoids that are connected to each other with four rectangles.
These congruent trapezoids are on the top and bottom of the prism which are called bases. 
The four rectangles are called the lateral faces of the trapezoid prism. 
A trapezoidal prism has six faces, eight vertices, and 12 edges. 
To construct a trapezoidal prism, we need to draw a trapezoid first that has 
two parallel sides and a height i.e. distance between the sides.
