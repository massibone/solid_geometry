Draw a cylinde with python

Surface Area of a Cylinder
If we know the radius and height of the cylinder then we can calculate the surface area of a cylinder using the formula:
2πr² + 2πrh 
(Where r is radius and h is the height 
of the cylinder).

Volume of a Cylinder
The amount of space inside the Cylinder 
is called as Volume. 
If we know the height of a cylinder 
then we can calculate the Volume of a cylinder using formula:
πr²h

The Lateral Surface Area of a Cylinder = 2πrh


Python Program to find Volume & Surface Area of a Cylinder
This Python program allows the user 
to enter the value of a radius and height.
