Draw a cylinde with python

Surface Area of a Cylinder
If we know the radius and height of the cylinder then we can calculate the surface area of a cylinder using the formula:



Surface Area of a Cylinder = 2πr² + 2πrh (Where r is radius and h is the height of the cylinder).

Volume of a Cylinder
The amount of space inside the Cylinder is called as Volume. If we know the height of a cylinder then we can calculate the Volume of a cylinder using formula:

Volume of a Cylinder = πr²h
