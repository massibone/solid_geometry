Draw a cylinde with python

Surface Area of a Cylinder
If we know the radius and height of the cylinder then we can calculate the surface area of a cylinder using the formula:



Surface Area of a Cylinder = 2πr² + 2πrh 
(Where r is radius and h is the height 
of the cylinder).

Volume of a Cylinder
The amount of space inside the Cylinder 
is called as Volume. 
If we know the height of a cylinder 
then we can calculate the Volume of a cylinder using formula:

Volume of a Cylinder = πr²h
Surface Area of a Cylinder = 2πr² + 2πrh 
(Where r is radius and h is the height 
of the cylinder).


The Lateral Surface Area of a Cylinder = 2πrh

We can calculate the Top Or Bottom Surface Area of a Cylinder = πr²

Python Program to find Volume & Surface Area of a Cylinder
This Python program allows the user 
to enter the value of a radius and height. 
Using these values, this Python program 
will calculate the Volume of a Cylinder, 
Surface Area of a Cylinder, 
Lateral Surface Area of a Cylinder, 
Top Or Bottom Surface Area of a Cylinder 
as per the formula.
